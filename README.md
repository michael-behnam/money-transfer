## Test Summary

The purpose of the test is to reproduce one feature: send and receive money between accounts.

You will have to design an API for the frontend to interact with the backend for making transactions.

Here is the story:

- An account can have either "pending", "verified", or "unverified" status.
- Only "verified" accounts can send or receive money.
- Other types of accounts when sending / receiving money, the API should return a 403 status code.
- Sending money from one account to another would mean that the money will be deducted from the sender and deposited to the receiver.

## Instructions

### Code

In the repository, you will find a Ruby on Rails application with only one single model: Account. It represents a specific account.

In order to implement the feature, you will have to extend the repository and add your logic on top of it.

Please keep the following points in mind:

- You only need to add logic / models / endpoints related to the above story.
- You can add all the models you need or extend the existing ones;
- You can add/modify as many gems as you want or change the Ruby version;
- Make your code as clear as possible, it should be understandable at a first glance (comments are more than welcome);
- Make sure that all of your APIs are well-documented, OpenAPI specification is preferred.
- Tests are more than welcome;

### Use Case

The use case we want to reproduce is the following:

- A verified user can send money to any verified account in the system.
- Users should be able to send their money by "email" or "phone number"
- Users should be able to see their transaction history, this includes inbound / outbound transactions.
